Normally, pressing CTRL + U on Chrome shows the page source code in a new tab. Now, press CTRL + U. PRESS IT!!!

<!--put this at the end of your body. because this has to be done after the dom is completed-->
<script type="text/javascript">
    document.body.onkeydown = function (e) {
        if (e.ctrlKey && e.keyCode == 85) {
            alert("Hello there my friend :)");
            event.preventDefault(); //to prevent chrome from doing what it does normally.
        }
    }
</script>
